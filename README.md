# hw-2-portfolio

## Asignment 
In this assignment I created a portfolio showcasing my skills using HTML and CSS and presenting past projects. 

In the porfolio the user can click through the navigation bar to direct them to specific section of the porfolio such as: About me, Work, and Contact me. 
The user can click on the links of the work and be redirected to a new tab where the work will be loaded. 
The user can also click on the github and linkin link on the contact me page to be redirected to my accounts.
The portfolio has a responsive layout where the user can resize the page to varying sizes and the content should resize accordingly.
